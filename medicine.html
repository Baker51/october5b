            <h1>HEAL THE PAST!</h1>

            <p class="introcopy">Few of us escape childhood unscathed and Hyapatia is no exception.  With the help of the medicine wheels, we can heal from our past.  The tools on the Native Strength path will show us how to connect with our inner children and wise elders.  Our inner elders can give us the love, acceptance, and understanding we deserve and have been missing.  They can show us paths to happiness and success we may have not noticed before.</p>


            <h1>Let me introduce you to centuries-old traditional mental health teachings of <span>Turtle Island (North America) known as Native Strength.</span></h1>
            <p class="introcopy">In 2001 Hyapatia was elected to the prestigious position of Blessed Woman for the Lost River band of the Cherokee. Every weekend she taught the people to speak Cherokee, conducted pipe ceremonies and presided over sweat lodges, healing ceremonies.</p>
