            <h1>Learn <span>with Hyapatia Lee</span> on Udemy.com</h1>
            <p class="introcopy">Hyapatia Lee studied for decades with medicine men and women from across the US, Canada, Australia, and the islands of Guam and Hawaii. She served as the Blessed Woman for the Lost River Band of the Cherokees where she taught the people to speak Cherokee, conducted healing ceremonies, sweat lodges, and taught the Native Strength alternative to the  contemporary mental health care system.
                After seeing how much this system helped the people of the Lost River Band, Hyapatia received permission from the elders to write the five books on which her TV series is based.
                Now you can personally learn this centuries-old system that draws heavily from the Mayan, Lakota, Cherokee, and Hawaiian traditions.</p>
