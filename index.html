            <h1>ABOUT ME...</h1>


            <p class="introcopy">After writing and starring in a variety of movies, including Killing
                Obsession starring John Savage, and The Wacky Adventures of Dr. Boris
                and Nurse Shirley starring Paul Bartell, Hyapatia fronted a rock and roll
                band featuring her original music. Double Euphoric opened for musicians
                like the Scorpions, Paul Rogers, and Ricky Medlock. While traveling,
                Hyapatia took time to study on the reservations with medicine men and
                women and wise elders. These elders have since passed and it has become
                obvious that sharing this information is imperative to its preservation.</span></p>
